Put your final project proposal here.
* I'm planning to create a snake game. 
* I've been playing this game ever since I was a child in my Nokia phone, 
and it would be nice to actually create that game.
* Week 1: set up cinder/clion/vs 2015 etc. on my new computer, 
    create the snake game board and the snake
* Week 2: Make the snake move in different directions as 
per input from keyboard and keep track of score as the snake eats more food
* Week 3: Take care of everything like increment the snake size 
after it eats and also keep a 'leaderboard' for different socres 
and TEST the project
* Week 4: I won't finish it in 3 weeks (I cannot think about anything else)
