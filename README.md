# Snake Game! 
I have created a simple classic snake game.<br />
The game is played by using the arrow keys on the keyboard - left moves the snake left, <br />
right moves the snake right, etc.<br />
If the snake eats the food (which is circular in shape), then both the size and the scores increase. <br />
The only way to stop the game is if you exit, or if the snake collides with the boundary or the snake itself.<br />
     
The code for this project was written in C++ (14.0) using the IDE CLion. <br />
The compiler used to compile the code was MS Visual Studio (14) <br />
The grahics used to display the snake, food, etc. was built using Cinder.
